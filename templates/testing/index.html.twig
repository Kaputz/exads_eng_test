        <p class="lead">Exads would like to A/B test some promotional designs to see which provides the best conversion rate.<br>
                        Write a snippet of PHP code that redirects end users to the different designs based on the data provided by this library: <br>
                        <a href="packagist.org/exads/ab-test-data">packagist.org/exads/ab-test-data</a></p>
        <p>The data will be structured as follows:</p>
<pre style="color: var(--bs-code-color);"><code>“promotion” => [
    “id” => 1,
    “name” => “main”,
    “designs” => [
        [ “designId” => 1, “designName” => “Design 1”, “splitPercent” => 50 ],
        [ “designId” => 2, “designName” => “Design 2”, “splitPercent” => 25 ],
        [ “designId” => 3, “designName” => “Design 3”, “splitPercent” => 25 ],
    ]
]</code></pre>
        <p>The code needs to be object-oriented and scalable. The number of designs per promotion may vary.</p>
