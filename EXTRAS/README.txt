- exads.sql contains a dump of the DB used, with create db, tables and insert data

- tv_shows_query.sql is not relevant for the project and was made as an extra with no real purpose. thought i'd include it just because why not

- EXADS is a Symfony application in a Docker container.
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
